# Digital Circuit Verification Platform Project

By: Yunfeng Liu 

## Project Design

I prepare to design a verification module which can be inserted into the designer's module. In order to facilitate a quick analysis, it is therefore necessary to do it in a host. The data is downloaded to the FPGA to start testing according to the instructions of the host.

## Design Diagram

The design diagram is as shown below.

It will describe the four modules in details in the followings. 

1. Frequencymeasurementmodule

Equal precision frequency measurement principle is as shown below.

According to the principle of equal precision frequency measurement, the coding diagram is as follows:
